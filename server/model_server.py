class ModelServer:
    """Manages multiple worker processes on a single node for model inference.

    This module provides the ModelServer class which manages multiple worker processes
    using torchrun for model inference. The server coordinates command
    distribution and status collection across workers.

    Key Components:
        - ModelServer: Main server class for managing distributed workers
        - Worker lifecylcle management via torchrun
        - Command IPC: sending inference requests to the workers
        - Status IPC: a compound status for all workers is collected

    The server operates by:
    1. Starting worker processes via torchrun
    2. Broadcasting inference commands to all workers
    3. Collecting status updates from workers

    Args:
        num_workers (int): Number of worker processes to spawn

    Usage:
        define in your environment which model to use. default:
        FACTORY_MODULE="cosmos_transfer1.diffusion.inference.transfer_pipeline"
        FACTORY_FUNCTION="create_transfer_pipeline"

        with ModelServer(num_workers=4) as server:
            server.infer({"prompt": "A beautiful sunset", "seed": 42})
